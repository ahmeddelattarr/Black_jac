This is a Blackjack game that I built using Python.

The game is played between a Player and a Dealer. The Player is dealt two cards, and the Dealer is dealt two cards, one of which is hidden.

The Player can choose to Hit or Stand. If they Hit, they are dealt another card. If they Stand, they keep their cards and the Dealer reveals their hidden card.

The Dealer must Hit until they reach a Hand value of 17 or more. If the Dealer's Hand value exceeds 21, they Bust and the Player wins. If the Dealer's Hand value is greater than the Player's Hand value, the Dealer wins. If the Dealer's Hand value is less than the Player's Hand value, the Player wins. If the Dealer's Hand value is equal to the Player's Hand value, the hand is a Push and neither player wins or loses.

The game is played until the Player decides to quit or they run out of chips.

Here are the steps on how to play the game:

1. Run the `blackjack.py` file.
2. The game will start by dealing two cards to each player.
3. The Player will be prompted to Hit or Stand.
4. If the Player Hits, they will be dealt another card.
5. If the Player Stands, the Dealer will reveal their hidden card and Hit or Stand until they reach a Hand value of 17 or more.
6. The winner of the hand will be determined based on the Hand values of the Player and the Dealer.
7. The Player will be prompted to play another hand.
8. If the Player chooses to play another hand, the game will start over from Step 2.
9. If the Player chooses to quit, the game will end.

I hope you enjoy playing Blackjack!
